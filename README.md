# PlanBub Project

## Project Overview

**PlanBub** is a tool designed to automatically filter job opportunities based on individual preferences, helping users efficiently find jobs that match their specific criteria. In the initial phase, the project will gather job data from multiple platforms using APIs, and in later stages, AI models will be integrated to enhance data filtering and analysis, leading to smarter job recommendations.

## Project Goals

- Provide personalized job recommendations based on user input.
- Utilize AI models to optimize job filtering and ensure the best-fit job matches.
- Continuously improve and expand the system to adapt to different platforms and user needs.

## Key Features

- **API Data Collection**: Fetch real-time job data from multiple job platforms using APIs.
- **AI Filtering**: Analyze and filter job postings with machine learning models to match user preferences.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: After inputting their job requirements, users will receive the best job matches.
- **Scalability**: The system supports future expansion and optimization to accommodate more platforms and changing user needs.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project infrastructure and gather data through APIs.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement basic job filtering functionality and integrate an initial AI model.
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize filtering algorithms to improve job recommendation accuracy.
4. **Phase 4**: Enhance the user interface and add more features and platform support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (planned)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express / AWS (planned)
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (TBD)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch (TBD)
- **APIs**: Support for multiple job platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)
